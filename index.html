<a id="git-vs-github" class="anchor" href="#git-vs-github" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Git vs. GitHub</h2>

<ul>
<li>Git: version control = "snapshots" of code; helps track progress

<ul>
<li>Git does not require Github
*Github: a cloud/program on the internet that stores your code - <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>
</li>
<li>Github requires Git</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<a id="initial-setup" class="anchor" href="#initial-setup" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Initial Setup</h2>

<ul>
<li>If you don't have a Github account or not using anything cloud-like you can use a one time setup command of <code>git config</code>, this is allow you to title your work and commits<br>
    * <code>git config --global user.name Your Name</code>: Sets a 1 time only global username to title your work<br>
    * <code>git config --global user.email YourName@email.com</code>: Sets a 1 time only global username to attach to your work<br>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you have created a Github account you can connect it with either Cloud9(c9) or Nitrous  </p>

<ul>
<li>To connect websites take the SSH Key from the website (local machine) and connect it to your account.<br>
</li>
<li>Every time you Save, Add, Commit and Push it will go to the cloud (Github)<br>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>To Save on Cloud9 you can set it to automatic save 
    * If you want to manually save go to File then click Save and make sure the circle turns into an x  </p></li>
<li>Next you would Add your code to the Stage by doing <code>git add .</code> or <code>git add --all</code> to get ready to commit<br>
</li>
<li>
<p>After Adding you then would have to use <code>git status</code> to see if it committed properly.  </p>

<ul>
<li>When you do git status you should get a message that says:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working directory clean
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Once you see the green you can now commit it and to commit it you would use:<br>
The message that should go between the quotes should be short and sweet, to show what you have done and what that command did <code>git commit -m "Your message"</code>; you should always have a message when committing becaue it helps you track your thought and edits</li>
<li>
<p>Once it has been committed you will see:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Type in git log to see if it was committed, at that time you will see your message to yourself and the time you committed it.<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p>*you will have to type in the command <code>git log</code> in order to see the message you attached to the commit and the time and date it was editied</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally when it is committed you can do <code>git push</code> or <code>git push origin master</code> in order to push your committed work up to the cloud (or what system your using)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>In order to make a repository through the command line:

<ul>
<li>create folder using <code>mkdir name-of-repo.md</code>
</li>
<li>use <code>cd folder-name.md</code> to go into that directory or folder</li>
<li>Create file but doing <code>touch ReadMe.md</code>
</li>
<li>Type <code>git init</code> to begin tracking your progress by turning it into a repository</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once made repository through the command line:</p>

<ul>
<li>If using Github with either cloud9 you would have to go to github and go to the + next to your icon then it will say Create New if hovered over it but when you click it you will see the words "New repository" and "New organization"</li>
<li>Click New repository and it will give you the options:</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Once you have created the repository on github and added it to your local machine (c9 or Nitrous) you can do:
        <code>git push origin master</code> or even <code>git push</code>  </p></li>
</ul>
